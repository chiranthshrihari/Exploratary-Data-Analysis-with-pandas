Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. The primary goal of EDA is to gain insights into the data and understand its structure, patterns, distributions, and relationships between variables.
EDA typically involve:
*Summary statistics
*Data visualization
*Data cleaning
etc
EDA is typically performed at the beginning of a data analysis project to guide further analysis and modeling decisions. It helps analysts and data scientists to understand the data better, formulate hypotheses, and identify potential problems that may need to be addressed before proceeding with more advanced analyses or modeling techniques.
